required features:
- when entering key need to hide the key with '...' ensuring others cant view it as its typed (implemented)
- add delays when using the application e.g. 'time.sleep(1)' (implemented)
- make code more reusable when possible. some functions maybe too long. (somewhat implemented) 


bugs:
potential security risk allowing a user to access private data by creating a new login with empty files and then implanting those files into that save allowing access into them.  (not fixable atm)

2. Change Currency(default: $):
3. View lifetime transaction history:
